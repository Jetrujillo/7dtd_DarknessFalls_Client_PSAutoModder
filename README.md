# 7dtd_DarknessFalls_Client_PSAutoModder
Powershell script to automatically backup and mod installation of 7dtd with the Darkness Falls mod.

You'll likely want to run this an an elevated (admin) Powershell session. Additionally, you may need to configure your system to run unsigned/trusted scripts. 

You can do that with the following command:
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

As a security precaution, please consider setting the execution to something more restrictive once you are done.

By default, the execution policy is "restricted":
Set-ExeuctionPolicy restricted
